May target a scoundrel or smuggler at a non-Kessel system (target is immune to Set For Stun) If target is lost, place cards here in Used Pile. When target reaches Kessel, draw five ''parsec'' destinies and stack them here (or this Mission is lost). Whenever you win a battle (or at start of your turn), take a card here in hand. When target returns to original system; Mission completed (counts as two Kessel Runs), Infiltration flips, may take into hand any one card from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. If total ''parsec'' destiny < 12 when completed, may subtract 1 from each of opponent''s destiny draws. May not be canceled.',",
