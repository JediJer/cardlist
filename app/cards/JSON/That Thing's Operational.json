While Death Star II orbits a system you occupy (except Endor), once during each of your control phases, opponent loses X Force, where X = 2 plus number of related battleground sites you occupy. Once during each of opponent''s control phases, opponent''s piloted starfighter here may attempt to ''blow away'' Death Star II. Draw destiny. Add 3 if armed with torpedoes or missiles. Add pilot''s ability. If total destiny > 8, starships here may attempt to ''escape'' and Death Star II is ''blown away'' (lose double Force).',",
