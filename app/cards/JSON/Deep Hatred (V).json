Vader''s Obsession may be played to initiate an epic duel as follows: If Mara is present with Luke, each player draws two destiny (if armed with a lightsaber, each destiny is +1). Add character''s ability. If Karrde on table, your total is -1. Higher total wins. If Luke loses, place him out of play and you may retrieve 5 Force. If Mara loses, cross her to the Light Side (she is now Mara Skywalker). Unless duel canceled or tied, for remainder of game any Mara is ability = 6, adds one battle destiny, and once per battle involving her, may cancel one just drawn destiny.(Original concept by Logan Suriano - 2005 New Year''s Resolution Contest)',",
